  Transit
</h3>

<p align="center">
Transit Theme is a modern JavaFX theme/style that can be used to give applications a different look and feel.
</p>
<br/>

## Real World Examples

## Documentation
Documentation of Transit can be found in this link: [Transit Java, JavaFX theme documentation](https://pixelduke.com/transit-java-javafx-theme/).

## Strengths and Key Principles
* Modern look and feel
* Zero tight coupling with this library: 
  * No new controls. Functionality is added "behind the curtains" to existing JavaFX controls through the Skin API (FXSkins library)
  * Setting and unsetting is seamless and easy (only 1 line of code) even on already existing apps that don't use this theme
* Looks integrated on Windows (80%/90% of desktop users use Windows) and also works well on other OSes
* Light and Dark versions;
* Easily override and customize colors by overriding JavaFX CSS variables
* Only relies on JavaFX CSS, JavaFX API and Java code (no other "foreign" technologies)
* Samples and theme tester app on samples sub-project
* Lots of real-world, recognized Java apps already using it (NASA's applications, applications used in the White House, etc.) (JMetro and Transit)
* Leverages lessons learned developing JMetro theme

This is a “pluggable” JavaFX theme (like JMetro).  
This means there’s zero coupling because this theme doesn’t define any new Controls and the developer only needs to run 1 line of
code to set the theme (this is all the coupling you’ll get).  
It adds features to the existing JavaFX controls that you regularly use (controls from the standard JavaFX API or from known third 
party libraries) by leveraging the JavaFX Skin API. This is achieved through the [FXSkins library](https://pixelduke.com/fxskins/) which Transit depends on.

## Getting Transit
You can get it through Maven Central.

Here are examples for Gradle and Maven (replace the version number with the version you want):

#### Gradle
```groovy
implementation 'com.pixelduke:transit:1.0.0'
```

#### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.pixelduke</groupId>
    <artifactId>transit</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Source code
As of the writing of this document, the code is being compiled on Java 17 and JavaFX 20.  

The transit-samples subproject has samples that you can run and check out how to use FXSkins.

## Running the sample demos
To run the demos,  enter the following command in the Command Prompt / Terminal, inside the project directory:
```
gradlew run
```
Be sure to have your JAVA_HOME environment variable correctly set.  
To choose which of the demos to run, change the "gradle.build" script file inside "transit-samples" folder and uncomment which
Application derived class you'd like to execute.

## Pull Requests (PR)
We welcome contributions via PR.  
Before submitting a PR please file an issue for prior discussion. This will avoid you wasting time with a PR that
might not be approved because, for instance, might be outside the intended scope of the project.

### Filing bugs
When filing bugs it's most often good practice to attach a small sample app (as small, simple and with the fewest lines of code as possible). This app when executed, should show the bug happening.  
The reason for this is the limited amount of resources and time I have and also because in the process of filing a bug, developers sometimes discover that the bug isn't in the library but somewhere else.   
Without a small example app, the issue might be closed prematurely.

## Feedback request
Please send pictures of your application that is using **transit**, or a site that shows your application. Or share it through Twitter (you can reference
me through my Twitter handle @P_Duke if you'd like).   
This is very important for me to know how users are effectively using it and make adjustments accordingly to make FXSkins better. 
Also, and if you allow it, showcase example uses.    
Seeing this library get used also always motivates me to keep working on it.
